            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The historical annual loading to, removal from, and cumulative burden in the Arctic Ocean for β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), an isomer comprising 5–12% of technical HCH, is investigated using a mass balance box model from 1945 to 2020. Over the 76 years, loading occurred predominantly through ocean currents and river inflow (83%) and only a small portion via atmospheric transport (16%). β-HCH started to accumulate in the Arctic Ocean in the late 1940s, reached a peak of 810 t in 1986, and decreased to 87 t in 2020, when its concentrations in the Arctic water and air were ∼30 ng m−3 and ∼0.02 pg m−3, respectively. Even though β-HCH and α-HCH (60–70% of technical HCH) are both the isomers of HCHs with almost identical temporal and spatial emission patterns, these two chemicals have shown different major pathways entering the Arctic. Different from α-HCH with the long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) as its major transport pathway, β-HCH reached the Arctic mainly through long-range oceanic transport (LROT). The much higher tendency of β-HCH to partition into the water, mainly due to its much lower Henry's Law Constant than α-HCH, produced an exceptionally strong pathway divergence with β-HCH favoring slow transport in water and α-HCH favoring rapid transport in air. The concentration and burden of β-HCH in the Arctic Ocean are also predicted for the year 2050 when only 4.4–5.3 t will remain in the Arctic Ocean under the influence of climate change.</p>
