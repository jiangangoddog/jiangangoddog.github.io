            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The development of a large-scale multi-media model for the assessment of chemical environmental exposure in China requires the corresponding regionalization of the country first. Based on spatially constrained clustering methods coupled with hydrological analysis methods, a nationwide comprehensive regionalization was achieved with ArcGIS software. This regionalization divided whole China into six comprehensive regions (CRs), including the South CR, North CR, Northwest CR, East CR, Northeast CR, and Southwest CR. Each of the six CRs again consisted of multiple small comprehensive regions, and there were a total of 38 such small regions in China. This study provided a useful method to conduct a nationwide regionalization, which could play an important role in the development of a large-scale multi-media models for the chemical exposure assessment in China.</p>
